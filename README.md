## :bookmark_tabs: Resume of application

I've decided to try to "change theme" to dark or light. So, I choose the React Switch to help me in this case. This is an easily application, made with ReactJS using also TypeScript and Polished to "dark" some colors. You can click on the switch and change the theme to "light" and "dark". I always wanted do something like that, and there it is.
